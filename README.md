This is the code for the frontend of the Imaging Mission Database (plandb.sioslab.com) along with the backend generation of the database.  The frontend is written in php, javascript and makes heavy use of Plotly.js (https://plot.ly/javascript/). The backend is written in Python and generates a MySQL database via Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) and SQLalchemy (https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

For extensive documentation on how the database is put together, please see: https://plandb.sioslab.com/docs/html/index.html
